"John G. Roberts, Jr.","We'll hear argument first this term in Case 16-285, Epic Systems Corporation versus Lewis, and the consolidated cases. Mr. Clement."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","We'll hear argument first this term in Case 16-285, Epic Systems Corporation versus Lewis, and the consolidated cases. Mr. Clement."
Paul D. Clement,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Respondents claim that arbitration agreements providing for individual arbitration that would otherwise be enforceable under the FAA are nonetheless invalid by operation of another federal statute. This Court's cases provide a well-trod path for resolving such claims."
Anthony M. Kennedy,Is that a concession that this is a concerted action?
Paul D. Clement,"Well, I -- I don't know that it is a concession that this --"
Anthony M. Kennedy,"I mean, if we adopted that premise for the opinion of the Court, wouldn't we have to say we assume that this is concerted action under the NLRA Section 7, but the FAA prevails?"
Paul D. Clement,"Well, I think what you would say, Justice Kennedy, is the concerted activity that's protected by Section 7 at most gets them to the threshold of the courthouse. But Section 7 is directed to the workplace, not the courthouse."
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"But the courthouse, Mr. Clement -- Mr. Clement, the courthouse is not at issue here as I understand it."
Paul D. Clement,"That's right, Justice Ginsburg, but it's collective action by the employees in the workplace."
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"Where does -- where does the NLRA say in the workplace? It says for the mutual benefit, mutual benefit and protection, mutual related protection."
Paul D. Clement,Right.
Sonia Sotomayor,"I'm sorry, but why --"
Elena Kagan,"Well, why is it directed there if it doesn't say that? I mean, in fact, we said the opposite in Eastex."
Paul D. Clement,"That's right, Justice Kagan, but the key words there are ""resort to."" There's no right in Section 7 or anywhere else in the NLRA to proceed as a class once you get there."
Stephen G. Breyer,"Well, that isn't the issue, is it? I mean -- at least to me."
Paul D. Clement,"So the short answer, Justice Breyer, and then I'd like to try to get out a longer answer, but the short answer is that, for 77 years, the Board did not find anything incompatible about Section 7 and bilateral arbitration agreements, and that includes in 2010 when the NLRB general counsel looked at this precise issue. Now, the longer answer is, from the very beginning, the most that has been protected is the resort to the forum, and then, when you get there, you're subject to the rules of the forum. So, for example, if an atypical worker decides that he wants to bring a class action on behalf of a handful of fellow employees, the -- he has the right to resort to the courts, but when he gets there, if he's confronted by an employer that says, wait a second, you don't satisfy numerosity, you don't satisfy typicality, then the employer doesn't commit an unfair labor practice by raising that argument."
Stephen G. Breyer,"No, of course not. But are you now conceding that, in these contracts in front of us, that they do not forbid two workers or three or four from going together, approaching a judicial forum, asking the judge to hear their case, or an arbitration forum, and of course, if it violates some rule of civil procedure other than that, it will be thrown out. Are you conceding that that's the issue? And then I don't know which one it violated, but nonetheless --"
Paul D. Clement,"Well, the issue is just as the employer can raise a numerosity defense or a typicality defense, the employer can raise a defense that you agreed to arbitrate this claim."
Sonia Sotomayor,Mr. Clement --
Paul D. Clement,"And that should be enforceable -- and then, when you get to the arbitration forum, just as you take Rule 23 as a given, you should take the rules of the arbitration forum as a given."
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"Mr. Clement -- Mr. Clement, do you recognize that this kind of contract, this -- there is no true bargaining. It's the employer says you want to work here, you sign this. It's what was called a ""yellow dog"" contract."
Paul D. Clement,"I have two responses to that, Justice Ginsburg."
Sonia Sotomayor,Mr. Clement --
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"Isn't it -- isn't it so that the -- the FAA, in its inception, was meant to deal with bargains between merchants, bargains between merchants who said the arbitration forum is much less expensive, so we want to go there, rather than the court, but it was commercial contracts that -- that triggered the FAA?"
Paul D. Clement,"Justice Ginsburg, this Court crossed that bridge in Circuit City."
Sonia Sotomayor,"But that's not true, Mr. Clement."
Paul D. Clement,So -- JUSTICE SOTOMAYOR -- if what it is doing is stopping you from taking activity that you are legally entitled to take.
Paul D. Clement,"So a couple of things, Justice Sotomayor."
Sonia Sotomayor,"Well, this issue wasn't raised there."
Paul D. Clement,"That's my point, which is to say that if, in fact, employment agreements were covered by the FAA, but if they were bilateral, they would actually be unlawful under the NLRA, boy, would that have been a useful thing to tell the Court in Circuit City. But no dog barked at that point."
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,But before the --
Paul D. Clement,"-- and when you get there, you're subject to the rules of the forum."
Anthony M. Kennedy,Let's take -- let's take two cases.
Paul D. Clement,"I think, ultimately, you decide both on the same principle."
Anthony M. Kennedy,Suppose it's for their wages.
Paul D. Clement,"If it's for their wages, I think if you have a couple of folks that are doing it in the workplace, that's concerted activity; they get to the forum and they get whatever rights to proceed concertedly that are available in the forum. If it's class action, it's arguably harder because you can file a class action and not collaborate with anybody."
Elena Kagan,"Well, Mr. Clement --"
Anthony M. Kennedy,You mean it's harder for the employer to prevail or for --
Paul D. Clement,For the employee.
Anthony M. Kennedy,"But your -- your case is really my first case, is it not? This is not really a class suit in its origins at least."
Paul D. Clement,"Well, there's three --"
Anthony M. Kennedy,Or am I wrong -- or am I wrong because there's Murphy Oil as well?
Paul D. Clement,"Yeah, there's three cases here."
Sonia Sotomayor,Is this contract --
Paul D. Clement,But once you're there --
Elena Kagan,"Mr. Clement, what about --"
Paul D. Clement,-- you're subject to the rules.
Elena Kagan,What about Section 102 and 103 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act? Because let's take Justice Kennedy's example.
Paul D. Clement,"Well, that -- that assumes the conclusion with all respect, Justice Kagan, which is, do you have --"
Elena Kagan,The only thing it assumed was that this was covered under Section 7.
Paul D. Clement,But --
Elena Kagan,You yourself said this is concerted and it's for mutual aid and protection.
Paul D. Clement,"I don't think that that's the way to read the statute, and I think the reason is that this isn't -- I don't think the way to see a traditional bilateral arbitration agreement is as a waiver of a Section 7 right or an NLGA right. It is just an effort by the employer and the employee to agree to set the rules for the forum of arbitration when you get there. And there's nothing sinister about leaving it to bilateral arbitration."
Elena Kagan,"Well, it's an agreement, but it's an agreement to waive a Section 7 right."
Paul D. Clement,"With all due respect, I think that assumes the conclusion."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Thank you, Mr. Clement. Mr. Wall."
Jeffrey B. Wall,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd just like to highlight one point in what Mr. Clement said."
Jeffrey B. Wall,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: I'd just like to highlight one point in what Mr. Clement said."
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"Mr. Wall, what about --"
Jeffrey B. Wall,-- from dismissal or retaliation.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"What about the reality? I think we have in one of these cases, in Ernst & Young, the individual claim is $1,800."
Jeffrey B. Wall,"So, Justice Ginsburg, with all respect, there are provisions in the arbitration agreements here, and they differ, that allow for payments of costs and fees."
Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Wall, we didn't have in those cases a third -- or raised a third statutory provision that protects a particular action, in any type of action in mutual aid or concerted activity like the NLRB or the Norris-LaGuardia Act. But putting that aside, I'm not sure that the FAA is now a rule of statutory construction."
Jeffrey B. Wall,"So, Justice Sotomayor, there's a lot there, and let me see if I can unpack a handful of things."
Sonia Sotomayor,Only when it's been a fight between whether that statute and the cause of action it provided overrode the FAA.
Jeffrey B. Wall,"Justice Sotomayor, with all respect, this Court's always said, look, is there a clear congressional command in the other statute."
Sonia Sotomayor,"Well, it was clear in saying that concerted activity cannot be interfered with."
Jeffrey B. Wall,"That's right, but for the first 77 years, here's what everyone, including the Board, understood that to mean."
Stephen G. Breyer,"Why do we have to go into all this class action business? I mean, it seems to me that in each of these agreements, the worker is forced to agree that I will not proceed concertedly, that means jointly, just one other person joining my action with his and going into arbitration and saying do both together."
Jeffrey B. Wall,"Justice Breyer, with all respect, the historical premise is just wrong. When you go back to 1935 and you come all the way through the cases, they summarize them as joint legal action or concerted legal activity, but that's only true if what you mean is the right to go to the forum and not be --"
Stephen G. Breyer,That's what I'm saying.
Jeffrey B. Wall,"But, Justice Breyer, that --"
Stephen G. Breyer,"But aside from that, everything else would apply?"
Jeffrey B. Wall,But that's not going to get them where they want to go.
Stephen G. Breyer,Maybe it won't. That's too bad.
Jeffrey B. Wall,I -- I think we're on the same page.
Stephen G. Breyer,Does it resolve the case or not?
Jeffrey B. Wall,"Well, the employees attempted to file a class action."
Sonia Sotomayor,"Well, that's the point with this."
Jeffrey B. Wall,"Justice Sotomayor, again, three quick points."
Sonia Sotomayor,That's assuming that test applies in this situation --
Jeffrey B. Wall,That's right.
Sonia Sotomayor,-- where a contract has been invalidated by statute.
Jeffrey B. Wall,"So, second, even if you try to go to the savings clause, which this Court has never done in a case like this --"
Sonia Sotomayor,Why would we even need to go there?
Jeffrey B. Wall,Well --
Sonia Sotomayor,Just read the
Jeffrey B. Wall,Because the NLRB on its face doesn't say anything about this.
Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, let's assume --"
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I'd like, Mr. Wall, I'd like you to finish your answer, but I have a question I'd like to get in before your time expires, if I could just note that."
Jeffrey B. Wall,So --
Sonia Sotomayor,Go ahead.
Jeffrey B. Wall,"So just to quickly finish the answer, I think, again, the question assumes the conclusion, which is it assumes that, when the Board, five years ago, took the concerted activities clause and stretched it for the first time to cover your ability to go pursue the rights, granted, collective procedures granted to you by some other statute, it assumes that those procedures that it picked up, which in every other context, like under the FLSA, are procedural, it somehow converted to be substantive and non-waiveable. And that's the move the Board can't make because it can't interpret the NLRA's ambiguity that way in the face of the FAA and federal rules like Rule 23, so that's the move that was off the table. And if you understand Section 7 to protect you from retaliation when you seek class treatment but not to give you an entitlement to proceed as a class in the forum, then you're right, everything fits together perfectly fine, and these arbitration agreements are enforced."
Elena Kagan,"Mr. Wall, can I interrupt you because --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Justice Alito, maybe this would be a good time --"
Elena Kagan,Justice Alito has one and then I do.
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","I'm sorry, maybe it's a good time for Justice Alito, if you like to --"
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Yeah, I just wanted to know what the -- what the Government's position is regarding the Norris-LaGuardia Act issue? Is it not before us, is it so closely tied to the NLRA issue that it is appropriate for us to decide it? Did you have an opportunity to brief it? What's your position on this?"
Jeffrey B. Wall,"I think both of those, Justice Alito."
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,Yes.
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Justice, maybe Justice Kagan can proceed now."
Elena Kagan,"I take it that both you and Mr. Clement agree that, if you had a discriminatory arbitration agreement, let's say an arbitration agreement that said that the employer will pay the arbitration costs of men but not women, that that would not be enforceable."
Jeffrey B. Wall,"So I think a couple of reasons, Justice Kagan."
Elena Kagan,Okay.
Jeffrey B. Wall,"Well, again, I don't think it's a magic words test -- and we agree with Petitioners on that."
Elena Kagan,"Well, here's -- here's one understanding -- may I continue?"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.",Sure.
Elena Kagan,"Is one understanding of Title VII says to the employer, you shall not discriminate, and Section 7 says to the employer, you shall not interfere with concerted activity, such as three guys joining together to bring a suit if they want to."
Jeffrey B. Wall,"Justice Kagan, it is not a fundamental attribute of arbitration to discriminate on the basis of race, age, or gender."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Thank you, Mr. Wall. Mr. Griffin."
Richard F. Griffin,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Board's rule here is correct for three reasons."
Richard F. Griffin,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The Board's rule here is correct for three reasons."
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,What do --
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Mr. Griffin, if -- if -- I'm not sure I fully understand your position."
Richard F. Griffin,"No, Your Honor."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.",So the arbitral --
Richard F. Griffin,It doesn't have to be arbitration.
"John G. Roberts, Jr.",Okay.
Richard F. Griffin,"The -- the Board's position is that, as this Court has said on multiple occasions, that the arbitral forum is the equivalent of the judicial forum for effectively vindicating statutory rights. So here, as has been mentioned, there are four people who are seeking to get paid in the Murphy Oil case for work that they did. If -- if the forum is available to them to proceed jointly --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.",Right.
Richard F. Griffin,"-- and the employer agrees to have it done in arbitration, that's fine from the Board's standpoint."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.",Okay.
Richard F. Griffin,"Because this Court has said on multiple occasions that those two forums are functionally equivalent for purposes of effectively vindicating the rights at issue, it's essentially like picking venue in --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Well, I don't -- yeah, I don't understand --"
Richard F. Griffin,-- two different federal courts.
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Right, I don't understand how that's consistent with your position that these rights can't be waived."
Richard F. Griffin,"It goes back, Your Honor, to the position the Board takes into account this Court's views with respect to the ability to effectively vindicate these rights in an arbitral forum."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.",We have said that with respect to individual arbitration.
Richard F. Griffin,"Well, Your Honor, we're talking about a rule here that doesn't just stop class -- or stop -- it stops any kind of joint activity."
Anthony M. Kennedy,"Excuse me, Justice Alito, quickly."
Richard F. Griffin,"They could do that, Your Honor, but it doesn't --"
Anthony M. Kennedy,"Well, that's collective action."
Richard F. Griffin,But it's not the -- it's not the collective action that's protected here.
Anthony M. Kennedy,"Well, they're proceeding concertedly."
Richard F. Griffin,But it doesn't allow the employer to choose which type of activities the employees can engage in.
Stephen G. Breyer,Wait a minute.
Richard F. Griffin,No.
Stephen G. Breyer,No? Okay.
Richard F. Griffin,"That's correct, Your Honor."
Anthony M. Kennedy,"Well, but the -- but the --"
Richard F. Griffin,This --
Anthony M. Kennedy,The question Justice Breyer asked is different than my question.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"In that event, you would --"
Anthony M. Kennedy,-- much of an advantage.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"You would have a judicial forum, if the employer doesn't want arbitration."
Anthony M. Kennedy,I fully understand that.
Richard F. Griffin,"They're -- they're constrained with respect to limiting employees' ability to act concertedly in the same way that, from the beginning of the National Labor Relations Act, individual agreements could not be used to require employees to proceed individually in dealing with their employers on terms and conditions."
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"What about the position that the Board -- I think both Mr. Clement and Mr. Wall emphasized that for 70 odd years, the Board was not taking the position that it is now taking, that it was not objecting to bilateral one-on-one arbitration."
Richard F. Griffin,"Well, with due respect to my colleagues, that's an inaccurate summary of the Board's precedent, Your Honor."
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,What do you do with the GC's -- the general counsel memorandum that said you can waive the right to file a collective lawsuit?
Richard F. Griffin,"With all due respect to the general counsel at the time, that memorandum was never adopted by the Board as the law of the Board and, in fact, was explicitly rejected in the Horton decision and subsequently in Murphy Oil."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, I'm curious about the -- the point that has been made that the Board doesn't allow class proceedings. There must be a reason -- you must have some explanation for how that can be reconciled with your -- your position, but I'd like to know what it is."
Richard F. Griffin,"Well, it's a misnomer to say that the Board doesn't allow class proceedings, Your Honor."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","And the other question I have is, how do you draw a distinction between a -- an agreement precluding class arbitration and all of the other Rules of Civil Procedure that limit the ability of employees to engage in collective litigation?"
Richard F. Griffin,"Well, here -- here, Your Honor, we -- we actually have agreement with -- with the other side."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, wait a minute. Why -- you say that -- what is the scope of the -- of the right to engage in concerted activity? Why -- if that's the case, why would it not abrogate any limitation in the rules of procedure that predated the enactment of that?"
Richard F. Griffin,"Well, the -- the Board's position, Your Honor, is --"
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, I want to --"
Richard F. Griffin,-- is the employees have to take these -- these provisions as they find them.
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.",So -- so is the argument is that the -- that the -- that restrictions in Rule 23 abrogate Rule -- Section 7 because they were enacted later?
Richard F. Griffin,"No, that's not it at all, Your Honor."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Well, then I don't understand your answer."
Richard F. Griffin,The -- the answer is people who have Section 7 rights are just like any other plaintiff and the requirements of Rule 23 with respect to numerosity or typicality are --
Elena Kagan,"Mr. Griffin, is this one way to think about the question? Of course, Section 7 doesn't extend to the ends of the Earth."
Richard F. Griffin,"That's -- that's entirely correct, Your Honor."
Stephen G. Breyer,You think all the rules apply.
Richard F. Griffin,Absolutely.
Stephen G. Breyer,And both sides are in agreement on that.
Richard F. Griffin,Yes.
Stephen G. Breyer,The question is whether you can resort to -- can they stop you from resorting to administrative and judicial forums?
Richard F. Griffin,"That's correct, Your Honor."
Stephen G. Breyer,"And in grievance arbitration, by the way, how -- I just wonder, because that's very common."
Richard F. Griffin,"Certainly, Your Honor, there are many instances where the union will take a grievance with respect to overtime that's not paid to multiple people on the same shift. This Court's decisions with respect to the Steelworkers Trilogy all involve arbitration situations that involve multiple parties' representative."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Let's say the arbitral forum says -- the rules of the arbitral forum says you can proceed individually, but you can -- and you can proceed collectively, but only if the class represents more than 50 people."
Richard F. Griffin,"That's a rule of the arbitral forum, and the employee takes the rules of the forum as they find them."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","So you have a right to act collectively, but only if there are 51 or more of you?"
Richard F. Griffin,"What -- no, Your Honor. What you have an opportunity to do is to try and utilize the rules that are available in the forum without the employer intervening through a -- a prohibition that's violative of Section 7."
Anthony M. Kennedy,"No, the hypothetical -- and the Chief can protect his own question -- the hypothetical is the contract says you have to have 50."
Richard F. Griffin,"Oh, I understood -- I'm sorry."
Anthony M. Kennedy,That's my understanding of the question.
Richard F. Griffin,"Well, I misunderstood the question."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.",Yes.
Richard F. Griffin,-- as opposed to the arbitration agreement between the parties.
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","No, the arbitral forum has rules, just like the Federal Rules of Civil Procedure."
Richard F. Griffin,"And I'm saying that those rules are equivalent, that you take -- the employee takes the rules of the forum as they find them. What is prohibited here under the National Labor Relations Act is an agreement by the employer that's imposed that limits the employee's right to take the rules as the --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.",Okay.
Richard F. Griffin,So it would be okay if the forum said that.
"John G. Roberts, Jr.",Yes.
Richard F. Griffin,It's not okay if there's an agreement between the employer and the employee that limits their right to proceed.
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","So -- so all the employer -- well, and why can the arbitral forum enforce the rule that says, basically, you cannot act collectively if it's fewer than 50 people?"
Richard F. Griffin,"Because the prohibition in the National Labor Relations Act in Section 8(a)(1) runs to employer interference restraint or coercion with respect to the rules, with respect to exercise of the rights under Section 7."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.",Okay.
Richard F. Griffin,-- about the forum's involvement.
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Well, but most arbitration agreements tell you what the forum is, whether it's the AAA or something else. So, if the employer/employee agreement says you shall arbitrate this under this particular arbitration forum, and those rules say we're -- we'll do collective arbitration, but only if you have more than 51 people because we think it's more efficient to have a smaller number arbitrate individually, that would be okay under your position?"
Richard F. Griffin,"Yes, Your Honor."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.",And what if the rules of the arbitral forum say no class arbitration?
Richard F. Griffin,"Your Honor, it would be -- it would be just as though, in the analogous circumstances, Congress said there were to be no class actions in court. The employee -- our position is that the employee's right to proceed is -- is in the forum under the rules of the forum."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","If that's the -- if that's the -- if that's the rule, you have not achieved very much because, instead of having an agreement that says no class, no class action, no class arbitration, you have an agreement requiring arbitration before the XYZ arbitration association, which has rules that don't allow class arbitration."
Richard F. Griffin,"Well, the provisions of the National Labor Relations Act run to prohibitions against employer restraint --"
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,Is that -- is that -- is there any arbitral forum -- I know the AAA allows class arbitration.
Richard F. Griffin,"The -- the National Academy of Arbitrators filed a brief -- amicus brief in this case, Your Honor, supporting the position that the Board took in Murphy Oil, and it addresses the circumstances under which, in both labor arbitration and employment arbitration, employees are able to proceed in joint collective representative actions."
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"There's one anomaly here, and I think you agreed that the Fair Labor Standards Act, where the substantive right comes from --"
Richard F. Griffin,That's correct.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"-- that under the Fair Labor Standards Act, which provides for an opt-in class proceeding, that right can be waived."
Richard F. Griffin,"Well, Your Honor, we -- we don't agree with respect to employees who have National Labor Relations Act rights, who also have FLSA rights, that there can be a waiver of the right to proceed jointly. It's -- if -- if you imagine it in mathematical terms, there's a set of people who have rights under the Fair Labor Standards Act. There's a lesser included subset of people who have rights under both the Fair Labor Standards Act and the National Labor Relations Act. And as to that lesser-included set, there's no ability to waive the right in an agreement with an employer to proceed collectively."
Elena Kagan,"Do you have a view, Mr. Griffin, as to whether bringing a class action is itself concerted activity by a single named plaintiff?"
Richard F. Griffin,"Yeah -- yes, Your Honor. That -- that law is essentially unchallenged here, and the Board's law is that, if an individual takes action to initiate, to induce, or to prepare for group action, that that is concerted activity as understood under Section 7. And -- and the Board specifically held in Murphy Oil -- and we've briefed this in our brief -- that -- that a class action fits within the notion of initiating, inducing, preparing for. In fact, the Lewis case involved an individual who filed a class action and then was joined immediately by a number of other plaintiffs."
Sonia Sotomayor,"Counselor, do you have any idea of how many union contracts provide exclusively for arbitration of disputes, individual and collective?"
Richard F. Griffin,It -- it is a fairly ubiquitous term in -- in -- in union collective bargaining agreements.
Sonia Sotomayor,And so is this the unusual case where the union hasn't negotiated that kind of contract?
Richard F. Griffin,"Well, this -- this involves individual employees."
Sonia Sotomayor,Involve non-union members.
Richard F. Griffin,"Yes, exactly."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Thank you, counsel. Mr. Ortiz. NOS. 16-285 AND 16-300"
Daniel R. Ortiz,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I may begin by answering a little bit more fully Justice Sotomayor's question at the end. Apparently -- approximately 55 percent of non-union private employees have contracts that are covered by mandatory arbitration agreements, and that covers about 60 million people."
Daniel R. Ortiz,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: If I may begin by answering a little bit more fully Justice Sotomayor's question at the end. Apparently -- approximately 55 percent of non-union private employees have contracts that are covered by mandatory arbitration agreements, and that covers about 60 million people."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.",So this decision in your favor would invalidate the 25 -- agreements covering 25 million employees?
Daniel R. Ortiz,"Yes, Your Honor. If I may respond to a few points of Mr. Wall's, there seems to be a belief on the employer's side that allowing employees to waive Section 20 -- Rule 23, Rule 20, and Section 16(b) rights under the Fair Labor Standards side -- Fair Labor Standards Act, except when the -- Section 7 of the NLRA is in the picture, somehow creates an anomaly. That is not the case, Your Honors. All these other -- Rule 20, Rule 23, and Section 16 create remedial mechanisms, but they create no substantive rights. Rule -- Section 7 of the NLRA, Section 2 of the Norris-LaGuardia Act, on the other hand, create substantive rights, but they create no procedural mechanisms."
Stephen G. Breyer,"Is there anything wrong, from your point of view, which taking this case in a very unsatisfactory way to everybody, except perhaps it's simple, is you just simply read the words what the employer cannot stop is joint effort, like making a joint claim, nothing to do with class actions, just making a joint claim, resorting to administrative and judicial forums for the purpose of making that joint claim? Now, the contracts seem to be an employer effort to stop an employee from doing that because they don't allow him to do that either in administrative or judicial forums. Now, suppose end of opinion, okay? Now, from your point of view, does that solve the case? Or does it just create a lot of problems? Is it totally out to lunch or what?"
Daniel R. Ortiz,"No, Your Honor."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Well, but, of course, there's another statute that has either equally or plainer language which says that arbitration agreements will be enforced according to their terms. Does it complicate the case to add that into it?"
Daniel R. Ortiz,"It complicates it one step, but what the FAA gives the FAA also takes away, Your Honor."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Well, that kind of begs the question."
Daniel R. Ortiz,"Sure, you can, Your Honor. Section 7 clearly prohibits this kind of behavior, and in Kaiser Steel, this Court itself said that such contracts are illegal and cannot be enforced by a court."
Stephen G. Breyer,"Why do you not -- I mean, look, I quoted a statute, didn't I?"
Daniel R. Ortiz,"Yes, you did, Your Honor. The language clearly controls."
Stephen G. Breyer,All right.
Daniel R. Ortiz,"Yes, Your Honor."
Stephen G. Breyer,"And Justice Cardozo said when in a comparable context, we exclude cases where the contract is in contravention of a statute."
Daniel R. Ortiz,"Yes, Your Honor."
Stephen G. Breyer,So I'm not quite ready to say it's more complicated.
Daniel R. Ortiz,"No, no."
Daniel R. Ortiz,The section -- Section 2 of the FAA was taken -- was not just inspired by the New York Arbitration Act but was taken word for word from the New York Arbitration Act.
"John G. Roberts, Jr.",Where -- where are you on my 50-employee hypothetical? Do you agree with the NLRB that it is all right to have a provision which says there is no class arbitration unless there are more than 50 people involved?
Daniel R. Ortiz,"The employer, Your Honor, cannot coerce employees into that forum, unless there is an alternative forum available with, say, the courts where --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Well, okay."
Daniel R. Ortiz,-- fewer than 50 employees could proceed.
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","But is your answer then that you disagree with the position of the NLRB? Because I understood them to say that, yes, once you're in the forum, you have to abide by the rules of the forum."
Daniel R. Ortiz,"Well, when you get to the arbitral forum --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.",Yeah.
Daniel R. Ortiz,-- you are bound by cause. But when an employer tries to coerce by making it a condition of continued employment that employees agree to a set of arbitral rules that make collective action impossible and at the same time takes away --
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Well, my point is it doesn't make collective action impossible."
Daniel R. Ortiz,"No, no, I -- I'm sorry, Your Honor."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.",Sorry it's so complicated.
Daniel R. Ortiz,"No, no, no, no. (Laughter.)"
Daniel R. Ortiz,"But so long as there's an alternative available where a group of 50 -- of less than 50 people could pursue, whether that's before --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","No, there's no alternative available because you're agreeing to arbitrate."
Daniel R. Ortiz,"Well, under --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","The whole point is no, you can't -- you can't engage in collective action if there are fewer than 51 people."
Daniel R. Ortiz,"Then, in our view, Your Honor, no, the -- the employer could not insist on that."
Sonia Sotomayor,I'm sorry.
Daniel R. Ortiz,"Yes, Your Honor, it would be."
Sonia Sotomayor,"It would be the intent to interfere with collective action. But let's assume it's an Ernst & Young that has 5,000 employees, I don't actually know the number, but for sake of argument, 5,000 employees."
Daniel R. Ortiz,"No, no, but the difference, Your Honor, is that under the federal rules, you can still have a joint action with two, three, four, five people, up to 50. And as I was assuming the hypothetical from the Chief Justice, under the -- the rules of the -- the arbitral forum he was putting forward, it would be either 50 or more, or nothing or one."
Sonia Sotomayor,And no joint activity of any --
Daniel R. Ortiz,No joint activity below 50.
Sonia Sotomayor,-- of any kind?
Daniel R. Ortiz,Right.
Sonia Sotomayor,All right.
Daniel R. Ortiz,That was the problem.
Sonia Sotomayor,"Yeah, that's --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","No, your -- your understanding is correct, I just wanted to make certain I understood that your position was different than the position of the NLRB on that."
Daniel R. Ortiz,"Thank you, Your Honor."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","On the right to -- if the right to engage in concerted activity includes the right to have -- to file a class action in federal court, how can an agreement provide that -- waive that right and require arbitration, even if arbitrations -- even if class arbitration is allowed, or can it not do that?"
Daniel R. Ortiz,"Your Honor, under Section 7, as long as joint legal action is available in one forum, that would be sufficient."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.",Why? Where do you get that out of the language of the statute?
Daniel R. Ortiz,"May I proceed, Your Honor?"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.",Sure.
Daniel R. Ortiz,"Your Honor, it's -- it represents an accommodation, if you will, with this Court's jurisprudence where this Court has said in a series of cases that the arbitral forum is equivalent to the judicial forum, so as long as one can proceed in one or the other, there should be no Section 7 violation."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Thank you, counsel. Mr. Clement, you have four minutes remaining."
Paul D. Clement,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
Paul D. Clement,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice."
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"What about the confidentiality agreements which, I take it, puts a damper on how -- how jointly these people can proceed?"
Paul D. Clement,"Well, they can proceed very jointly before they get there."
Elena Kagan,"But, Mr. Clement, usually, usually when you have a right, the fact that there is one way to exercise a right left over does not make it okay if we've taken away another 25 ways of exercising the right. You know, when we think about the First Amendment, we don't say we can ban leafleting because you can always write an op ed."
Paul D. Clement,"Well, Your Honor, I'm not sure you should blame me for that, because as I understood the colloquy with Justice Alito, that's exactly their position."
Sonia Sotomayor,"Mr. Clement, how -- and these are related questions, which is how does an employee with these confidentiality agreements or even with this agreement in place -- how are they able to bring a pattern or practice or disparate treatment cause of action? And explain to me why employers would prefer an arbitration of 100 different claims, let's say in a religious accommodation case, where half the arbitrators say you must honor this -- those 50 people's religious claims and the other 50 arbitrators say no, you don't have to. Where -- how are employers and employees helped with such a system and how with these individual arbitration claims that have become more recent in -- in modern times -- this is not -- these bilateral arbitration agreements have not been the norm; they've been the norm in more recent times. When the Court said that we weren't going to recognize class actions in arbitrations, that's when employers jumped to this."
Paul D. Clement,"Let me try to deal with them, Justice Sotomayor."
Sonia Sotomayor,"Well, it was bilateral commercial arbitration."
Paul D. Clement,"Okay, but again, this Court crossed that bridge in Circuit City. Now, when you get to -- you raised a concern about what if you can only bring a pattern and practice case with, you know, more than one plaintiff? Well, you know, the parties really haven't briefed that, but that did come up a lot in Italian Colors because the Second Circuit had a rule that said that you could only bring a pattern and practice case pursuant to a class action. And try as I might to say that that was a problem with effective vindication, I only got four votes."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Thank you, counsel."
