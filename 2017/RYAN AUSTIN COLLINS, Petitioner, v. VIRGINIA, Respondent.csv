"John G. Roberts, Jr.","We'll hear argument next in Case 16-1027, Collins versus Virginia. Mr. Fitzgerald."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","We'll hear argument next in Case 16-1027, Collins versus Virginia. Mr. Fitzgerald."
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"Thank you, Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: The warrant requirement for the home and curtilage cannot be overthrown by the automobile exception. Under the Commonwealth's argument, on probable cause alone, an officer may search a vehicle anywhere that he finds it and may go anywhere that he needs to in order to access that vehicle. That rule cannot survive foundational Fourth Amendment principles."
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,Suppose the -- the police have probable cause to believe that the vehicle is stolen and they even get a warrant to inspect the vehicle.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"Well, Your Honor, the -- the warrant would specify the place to be searched for the car."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","But what if it didn't? So they have a warrant here, let's say, to search for -- they have probable cause to search this thing covered by a -- a tarp."
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"Well, Your Honor, the Fourth Amendment, by its terms, requires a warrant to specify the place to be searched. So if they've seen the motorcycle in that spot and they get a warrant, the warrant would say this house on Dellmead Avenue, may have included the picture, and it would, by its terms, authorize the access to that."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.",And this is my question about your argument based on the curtilage.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"Well, Your Honor, so here's -- here's the way that I think about that: If you're looking at the terms that support the automobile exception, you have ready mobility and you have the lessened expectation of privacy. But the curtilage and the home are essentially more important concerns than that. So, for instance, if I had a fistful of cocaine and I'm out in public, cocaine is extremely readily mobile."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Yeah -- no, I think the privacy interests would be quite different if this was in the house or if it was in the garage, but this is not in either of those places."
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"It's visible from the street from directly at the end of the driveway, yes, Your Honor."
Sonia Sotomayor,"How much does your argument depend on us viewing this as two things: One, a trespass on private property, the curtilage, and then a search within that private space? Is your argument hinged on that distinction?"
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"Well, I think we make that distinction because it's important just to make sense of the Fourth Amendment to think about it step-by-step."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","So if this motorcycle were parked on the street and it was covered by a tarp, you would say that the motor vehicle exception doesn't apply because it's covered by a tarp?"
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"No, Your Honor."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.",So what's the relevance of the tarp?
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"The relevance of the tarp is essentially that there is a -- there is some expectation of privacy in a tarp, particularly placed within the curtilage of the home."
Sonia Sotomayor,So what difference does it make that the tarp was there?
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"The tarp perhaps makes it particularly clear that the officer was undergoing a search, not just, say, walking where he could have said, oh, this is almost on the way --"
Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, let's change the hypothetical."
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,Right.
Sonia Sotomayor,-- have to open the car door.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,I don't think you would have to move something on the motorcycle. And so --
Sonia Sotomayor,Let's just assume that.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,So if there --
Sonia Sotomayor,Does your argument still stand?
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"Yes, Your Honor."
Stephen G. Breyer,"Well, why? Because, I mean, suppose the policeman is standing on the sidewalk."
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"Close, Your Honor. So if --"
Stephen G. Breyer,What is the law there?
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,If an officer standing on the sidewalk looks into the window of a house and sees a pile of drugs through the window --
Stephen G. Breyer,Yeah.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,-- that creates probable cause that would permit the officer to get a warrant to go into the house.
Stephen G. Breyer,"Well, so he goes, gets a warrant, and they throw it all down the sink --"
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"Well, this --"
Stephen G. Breyer,"-- and, of course, there is nothing by the time he comes back."
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,If --
Stephen G. Breyer,"-- but you know the area of this law better than I do, I -- I guess, and that isn't so."
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,So it's not impossible that there would be an exigent circumstance there.
Stephen G. Breyer,"Well, no, I've given you the facts."
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,It's -- it's particularly important to that hypothetical that there's someone wandering around inside --
Stephen G. Breyer,Okay.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,-- because the introduction of the person is important --
Stephen G. Breyer,He has reason to think there's somebody in the house.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,Right.
Stephen G. Breyer,Or no --
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"-- an exigency could be created, if there's a person who's wandering --"
Stephen G. Breyer,All right.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"So just to be clear, in this case, the Supreme Court of Virginia steered away from exigency and said, no, we're not going --"
Stephen G. Breyer,I know that.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,It -- it is not a case about exigent circumstance.
Stephen G. Breyer,But you just told me I'm wrong.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,This is not an exigency case.
Stephen G. Breyer,"No, no, I know that. What I'm trying to get at is I suddenly thought: I don't understand this case because you said the circumstance is the same without a tarp."
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,So the --
Stephen G. Breyer,That's why I asked the question.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"So the officer testified that when he arrived at the property, there was no one home."
Elena Kagan,"Mr. Fitzgerald -- I'm sorry, did you --"
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,There -- there's no obvious exigency here and that would be an issue for remand in this case.
Elena Kagan,"Can I go back to the exchange that you had with Justice Alito? When you gave your hypothetical about the drugs and he said, well, that would be different, it would be -- it's very different in a home, but here you have the motorcycle parked out in the open, on the driveway in this enclosure, where you can see it from the street. And I guess this is the question I want to ask you."
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,Yes.
Elena Kagan,"You know, it's not -- it's not disputed here."
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"Yes, Your Honor."
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,Isn't it a problem --
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.",But the --
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,-- whose -- whose curtilage it is? Here we're told that there was a close relationship between the defendant and the homeowner.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,And it's the same -- parked the same way.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"So -- so you may, Your Honor, be -- it sounds like you are describing a difficult case of Fourth Amendment standing or right to object."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","Did -- coming back to Justice -- to the -- to the question, did we say in Jardines that the curtilage is to be treated the same as the house for all Fourth Amendment purposes? I thought the issue in Jardines was whether -- was whether officers who did not have probable cause were permitted to walk up to the front of the house, at which point they acquired probable cause."
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"Well, yes, Your Honor."
Sonia Sotomayor,"Counsel, we permit the police to seize items in plain view in a home."
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,The -- the record is unclear.
Sonia Sotomayor,But how do you --
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,-- but -- but it's --
Sonia Sotomayor,"-- address the way I'm looking at this, which is --"
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,It's --
Sonia Sotomayor,"-- the police are standing there, they see something and have probable cause to believe that it's incriminating evidence."
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"So, Your Honor, this is not a plain view case, because in Horton versus California, the Court said, in order for plain view to apply to allow the seizure of the thing, the officer must have a right of access to the thing itself. So there's no right of access. There's no implied license to go into the curtilage to look for evidence that you have seen."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.",Do you dispute the fact that they had probable cause to believe that the thing that they saw covered by the tarp was the motorcycle they were looking for?
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,We do not dispute that.
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.",Okay.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"And so, ultimately, here this is a fairly straightforward case, I think."
Stephen G. Breyer,"But you -- you don't dispute -- in other words, you -- in your view, you agree that the policeman standing on the sidewalk knows that that item covered by -- or at least has probable cause to it -- covered by the tarp is the possibly stolen motorcycle? You agree with that?"
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"He -- he has probable cause to believe that is the motorcycle that eluded him in traffic, that he was looking for. Of course, there could be other things under the tarp as well as the motorcycle."
Stephen G. Breyer,So he didn't really have to lift the tarp at all?
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"Well, he wanted to lift the tarp to be sure."
Stephen G. Breyer,So that's his decision; he didn't have to.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"Well, he didn't have access."
Stephen G. Breyer,"No, I know that, but I'm saying if he'd had access to it."
Stephen G. Breyer,"Now, if that had given him access, he could have just grabbed the whole thing, tarp and all."
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,Well --
Stephen G. Breyer,Do you agree with that or don't you agree with that?
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"No, Your Honor."
Stephen G. Breyer,You don't agree with that? Okay.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"He is investigating the -- the crime of eluding him in traffic. Ultimately, that is a crime committed by the driver."
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,Which is different from a stolen vehicle.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"Yes, Your Honor."
Sonia Sotomayor,"Ahh, so --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.",So --
Sonia Sotomayor,-- he didn't know this was stolen property yet? The VIN number gave -- this is like Jardines.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"That is what he stated, yes."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","No, it's not like Jardines --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","But you could see under -- you could see under the tarp, right, some identifying characteristics in the extension of the wheel that allowed it to go 140 miles an hour and the color scheme and all that?"
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"Well, you couldn't -- you couldn't see the color scheme, but you could see the -- the basis for the probable cause is he has the Facebook picture that shows --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.",Yeah.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,-- the motorcycle not under a tarp.
"John G. Roberts, Jr.",This would be --
Sonia Sotomayor,But it's probable cause to arrest the driver.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,So --
Sonia Sotomayor,"-- charging with elusive driving or whatever, dangerous driving."
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"It is a police investigation in which he's ultimately trying to find the driver, first by verifying that he's found the motorcycle."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","You can't -- you can't seize -- on this basis of the same probable cause, you can't seize the motorcycle, putting aside the curtilage question? You have probable cause to believe that this person was driving that type of motorcycle. I -- it's an honest question."
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"I think that you do, Your Honor, but the curtilage -- it's --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","No, I know the curtilage --"
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"I guess we can't really set that aside, but -- but --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Yes, but maybe -- and maybe this is the same question Justice Breyer was asking, but let's say the motorcycle was on the -- covered with a tarp on the side -- not the sidewalk, the little path to go to the door, in other words, a place where he did have a license to go, right? He said I'm just going to go knock and talk."
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,No.
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Would he -- he couldn't seize that, even with probable cause?"
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"No, that -- that is outside the implied license of his ability to go and knock and talk at the door of that residence, Your Honor."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.",It's not an additional search.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"No, you have -- you have the right to use your eyes, but you don't have the right to go beyond what a reasonably respectful person approaching the door would do."
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.",He had probable cause -- you -- I thought you admitted he had probable cause to believe that the thing covered by the tarp was the motorcycle that he -- had eluded him by driving 140 miles an hour.
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,Yes.
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.",Right?
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,Yes.
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","So he has probable cause to search that motorcycle, to find the -- the vehicle identification number, which will tell him the owner of the motorcycle, which will help him arrest the person who committed this crime, right?"
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,Yes.
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","So the case comes down to this: If the motorcycle were parked on the street or maybe further down the driveway, and, therefore, not in the curtilage, they wouldn't need a warrant."
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"Yes, Your Honor --"
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.",That's what the case comes down to?
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,Yes.
Anthony M. Kennedy,Did the police have an interest in seizing or securing this motorcycle as soon as possible?
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"No, Your Honor. There -- there's no exigent circumstance in this case."
Anthony M. Kennedy,"The police could leave it sit there for a couple days and just get around to it? Isn't this a -- A, a dangerous item and it was used for a dangerous purpose; and it's the instrumentality and evidence of a crime?"
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"Your Honor, it's exactly the same --"
Anthony M. Kennedy,And it's movable?
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,It's exactly the same as if he had seen something readily movable like drugs through the window of a house.
Anthony M. Kennedy,It's the same as if the car was --
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,No other state is saying this would be --
Anthony M. Kennedy,"-- it's the same as if the car -- there were a car but the car were under repair, all the tires were off the car and the hood was up and the engine was taken out? The same, no difference?"
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"Well, Your Honor, this Court has not -- you know, readily mobile can include a car that's wrecked."
Anthony M. Kennedy,"So you think that's irrelevant, its mobility and its -- and its -- the ease of moving it is irrelevant to this case? That's what you want us to say?"
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"It is -- it is not any more readily mobile than things that require a warrant, such as illegal drugs."
Anthony M. Kennedy,You want to say that mobility is irrelevant to this case?
Matthew A. Fitzgerald,"Yes, I will say that. If I may reserve the balance of my time."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","Thank you, counsel. Mr. Cox."
Trevor S. Cox,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Officer Rhodes's search of the motorcycle should be upheld for three reasons. First, the search occurred outside the firm, bright-line of the house where the justifications for the automobile exception fully apply. Second, Officer Rhodes had probable cause before he ever stepped foot on the driveway."
Trevor S. Cox,"Mr. Chief Justice, and may it please the Court: Officer Rhodes's search of the motorcycle should be upheld for three reasons. First, the search occurred outside the firm, bright-line of the house where the justifications for the automobile exception fully apply. Second, Officer Rhodes had probable cause before he ever stepped foot on the driveway."
Sonia Sotomayor,"In your brief, you seem to say that you're not -- you don't seem to say -- you say you're not taking a position on whether an officer can break into a garage or walk into a garage that's closed but not locked. So you -- you seem to be suggesting that the mobility of the automobile, wherever it is, permits the police to enter."
Trevor S. Cox,This -- this Court has never said that the mobility changes depending on where it is.
Sonia Sotomayor,"Is that a yes to my question? Are you -- are -- because that seemed to be what the Virginia -- what the court below is saying, which is the -- where the item is located is irrelevant."
Trevor S. Cox,The Supreme Court of Virginia did not impose that restriction.
Sonia Sotomayor,"Well, you're saying it's not necessary because the facts don't support it, but does the logic of their holding and your position require that outcome? What -- what -- how do we -- and do we basically say, contrary to our rule, that the curtilage is not part of your home? We know it is."
Trevor S. Cox,Sure.
Sonia Sotomayor,All right.
Trevor S. Cox,"We don't -- we don't read Jardines and the other court cases like Oliver as saying that the curtilage and the home should be treated the same for all purposes. For determining one's reasonable expectations of privacy, you might treat the curtilage and the home the same."
Neil Gorsuch,"So under that rule, though, police could, as I understand your position, search for cars in garages, closed garages, carports, anywhere on a property, no matter how closely attached, or even if firmly attached to the house?"
Trevor S. Cox,"No, not everywhere on -- on the premises, Your Honor."
Neil Gorsuch,Not in the house but on the curtilage.
Trevor S. Cox,"Not in a house, but a garage is often considered part of the house."
Neil Gorsuch,Okay.
Trevor S. Cox,If it's not part of the dwelling.
Neil Gorsuch,Not many people live in their garage.
Trevor S. Cox,Garages are commonly used --
Neil Gorsuch,Correct?
Trevor S. Cox,"-- Your Honor, for a lot of residential purposes."
Stephen G. Breyer,"So -- so look, I want to ask you two questions, and the first is just to be sure I have the basics right."
Trevor S. Cox,Yes.
Stephen G. Breyer,"Okay? The basics question is a weird hypothetical, but I'm using a weird hypothetical for illustration. The mad art burglar has just stolen The Thinker, Rodin's Thinker from the local museum."
Trevor S. Cox,Yes.
Stephen G. Breyer,When he should -- that's the law.
Trevor S. Cox,"That's my understanding, Your Honor, yes."
Stephen G. Breyer,"He told the confederates, they're not going to -- The Thinker is not going to escape, it weighs 2,000 pounds, okay?"
Trevor S. Cox,Unless there was some other exigent circumstance to justify it --
Stephen G. Breyer,Okay.
Trevor S. Cox,"-- but under your hypothetical, I don't see any."
Stephen G. Breyer,Okay.
Stephen G. Breyer,"And there, if, soon as the smoker, whom he sees in the window or he believes he's off on the side, as soon as he gets an inclination there's a policeman around, I'll tell you where all that drug is going to be, right down the sink, okay? In that case, he doesn't need a warrant, because there's exigent circumstance. Is that right?"
Trevor S. Cox,That -- that's right.
Stephen G. Breyer,All right.
Trevor S. Cox,"If the destruction is imminent, then it might not --"
Stephen G. Breyer,And what we don't have in this case is we do not have the exigent circumstance.
Trevor S. Cox,I think you do have exigent circumstances.
Stephen G. Breyer,"Well, you might have it, but that's not in front of us."
Trevor S. Cox,There is a categorical exigency to automobiles.
Stephen G. Breyer,"But now -- wait, there are two differences between my example. One, it's curtilage, not house."
Trevor S. Cox,I -- I -- I think that's --
Stephen G. Breyer,If it's a big box and carries a motorcycle --
Trevor S. Cox,Right.
Stephen G. Breyer,"-- like a tarp, you can say yes -- you want to say yes, okay, and I would just wonder why? Why?"
Trevor S. Cox,"Well, the court -- the court has --"
Stephen G. Breyer,"I mean, it's on the driveway."
Trevor S. Cox,"I'll -- I'll try to answer, and I'm sure you'll correct me if I misstate what the hypothetical says. My understanding is that there was a virtual certainty here that this was the same motorcycle under the tarp."
Elena Kagan,"Mr. Cox, can --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","I thought your point was that -- that you understood on the automobile exception for it to have -- include a categorical exigency aspect. In other words, while it's not the case that you see the guy, you know, revving up the motorcycle about to take off, which would be an exigent circumstance, but you think because -- you want to extend or apply the automobile exception to stationary vehicles on -- on -- within the curtilage because you think all the guy has to do is he sees the police officer, he runs out of the house, starts it up and goes away."
Trevor S. Cox,"Yes, Your -- Your Honor."
Sonia Sotomayor,"Well, then that -- that goes back to my basic question, which is how do I differentiate the -- the car in the garage if -- if -- if -- or the car through a window that you can see? You would say that exigent circumstance -- that's what Virginia Court appeared to say, that it created an absolute rule."
Trevor S. Cox,Yes.
Sonia Sotomayor,And that's the rule you want us to uphold?
Trevor S. Cox,It -- it could.
Neil Gorsuch,"Well, and --"
Trevor S. Cox,"-- and not make any new law, if you wanted to."
Neil Gorsuch,"-- and then we should just go ahead and do the same thing for drugs and papers too, because -- and Entek, we can overrule Entek while we're at it, going all the way back to the founding because, you know, we can see somebody, they have a fireplace, they have a chimney, they could destroy the papers that we see through the window or the drugs."
Trevor S. Cox,So this gets to Justice Sotomayor's question as well.
Sonia Sotomayor,It's a second. The difference between opening a garage door and just walking out and getting into a car is de minimis.
Trevor S. Cox,Right.
Sonia Sotomayor,"You can -- you can -- you know, it happens just as quickly."
Trevor S. Cox,Right.
Sonia Sotomayor,"So if it -- if it -- if the distinction -- and there is no real distinction -- why, as Justice Gorsuch suggested, you're asking us to expand the automobile exception dramatically and to basically make an all-time exception forever? Even if the driver -- even if the police know that the driver of this car is away on vacation and won't be returning for two weeks, even if they know that, they're not required to go to a magistrate and get a warrant?"
Trevor S. Cox,"Your Honor, that's been this Court's law for decades."
Neil Gorsuch,"Well, counsel, when I -- when I look at the automobile exception's history and go back to Carroll, it was actually an originalist opinion that looked at cars and -- and analogized them to ships and vessels, going all the way back to 1790."
Trevor S. Cox,Right.
Neil Gorsuch,"Well, I just cited the Supreme Court's jurisprudence in Carroll."
Trevor S. Cox,Yes.
Neil Gorsuch,"So I'm not sure it's fair to point it, the arrow, in this direction, counsel."
Trevor S. Cox,"Well, Carroll did involve a -- a car that was on the street, but there have been many cases since then in the 90 years since Carroll where it's been applied when the car is totally immobile and not on the open road."
Elena Kagan,Mr. Cox.
Trevor S. Cox,-- ever since then.
Elena Kagan,"I mean, one of the things you're saying is that we basically should give -- we shouldn't pay attention to the fact that this was on the curtilage, and you said earlier -- to a different question, you said, well, you're committed by Jardines to treat the curtilage as the home for purposes of expectation of privacy, but for other purposes, you can make a distinction between the two. And I'd like to know more about that. For what other purposes can you make a distinction between the two? And why can you make a distinction between the two for those purposes when you can't make a distinction between the two for this fundamental question of where you have an expectation of privacy?"
Trevor S. Cox,Sure.
Elena Kagan,I'm sorry.
Trevor S. Cox,"So, you know, you cannot search inside the house without a warrant unless there are exigent circumstances or if there's consent."
Elena Kagan,"It -- it's just -- Mr. Cox, it's really a simple question."
Trevor S. Cox,"For purposes of when you have probable cause to search and a warrant -- a warrant exception applies, then you don't treat them the same."
Elena Kagan,And -- and why is that -- why would you treat -- why would you not treat them the same for purposes of when you need a warrant if you do treat them the same for deciding whether there's a reasonable expectation of privacy in them?
Trevor S. Cox,"Well, the -- the Court said in Ross that when the automobile exception applies, you are -- you're committed to the same search with the same scope as you would be if you had a warrant."
Elena Kagan,"You see, I don't know. Just -- when I read Jardines, here's what I take it to say: I take it to say the home is the most sacrosanct of places."
Trevor S. Cox,"If -- if that's the case, we have a much -- much harder case to make, but I don't think -- I don't read Jardines as overruling Santana."
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,Can -- can you remind me what you said about the enclosed garage with the door? Would that be treated like the home?
Trevor S. Cox,Yes.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"Now, that there is a real problem because you're making a distinction between people who can buy houses with garages and people who are less well heeled and only have a port or a patio for the car instead of a garage."
Trevor S. Cox,I guess what I would say is that the Fourth Amendment protects the same quality of privacy but maybe not the same quantity of privacy for everyone.
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","I mean, they're --"
"John G. Roberts, Jr.",I don't know why you're --
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.",-- garages.
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","I'm not sure why you are arguing -- if I understand your answers to -- to Justice Kagan, you seem to say, okay, let's say the -- the probable cause is based on the -- the fact that you know that the drugs are in -- you know, foot-by-foot orange boxes and you see from -- in the carport, you know, foot-by-foot orange boxes. And you -- you seem to be treating that the same as the situation when you have the motorcycle or an automobile, but I thought part of your argument was that the automobiles were inherently different because somebody could just jump on the motorcycle and ride away, while they wouldn't have the same mobility issues with respect to the box, the orange boxes. Now, are you arguing -- do you -- does your argument extend to immobile items in the carport because it's curtilage rather than the house, or is it limited to the mobility that's characterized the automobile exception?"
Trevor S. Cox,Yes.
"John G. Roberts, Jr.","And then the problem with that, of course, is, we've said, the curtilage is like the house and -- maybe you would."
"John G. Roberts, Jr.",-- you don't -- you can just go in because it's mobile and they got it in there somehow; they can get it out? So you don't recognize a distinction between the curtilage and the house for the purposes of the vehicles that are mobile?
Trevor S. Cox,The Court has laid down a categorical exception.
Sonia Sotomayor,I'm sorry.
"Samuel A. Alito, Jr.","But, Mr. Cox, you know the -- the Fourth Amendment says the people have the right to be secure in their homes, papers, persons, and effects."
Trevor S. Cox,That -- that's correct.
Stephen G. Breyer,A porch is --
Trevor S. Cox,And the search that occurred here was very reasonable.
Sonia Sotomayor,You see the problem I have is that the court below didn't do this.
Trevor S. Cox,That's true.
Sonia Sotomayor,It didn't reach exigency.
Trevor S. Cox,The Supreme Court of Virginia had found that.
Sonia Sotomayor,"Yes, but the -- the supreme court --"
Trevor S. Cox,That's right.
Sonia Sotomayor,-- which is the court we're reviewing --
Trevor S. Cox,-- they didn't make its own exigency analysis.
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"Well, that would be a question for remand because it wasn't reached by the Virginia Supreme Court."
Trevor S. Cox,"We would -- we would be confident if -- if it were remanded that we would prevail on that, yes, Your Honor. Officer Rhodes had probable cause before he ever stepped foot on the driveway to know that this vehicle was stolen."
Ruth Bader Ginsburg,"You say if there's probable cause to get a warrant, then you don't need a warrant, and that's the automobile exception. Are there -- is there any other exception like that where the test of whether you need -- if you have probable cause, forget it, forget the warrant, that probable cause alone is enough?"
Trevor S. Cox,"Well, I think under a plain view you'd have to have some -- some probable cause to believe that what you were say -- seeing was contraband or otherwise evidence of crime."
Anthony M. Kennedy,"Well, the -- the fact that this motorcycle was in plain view, subject to the tarp being on it, was a factor in the decision by the Supreme Court of the State of Virginia, was it not?"
Trevor S. Cox,I -- I think --
Anthony M. Kennedy,I -- I thought they -- I thought they relied upon the fact that it was in plain view with -- with the tarp on it.
Trevor S. Cox,"I think that that is mentioned, but I think the probable cause that he -- that existed was formed, at least in part, by the comparison of the photograph on the Facebook page and when Officer Rhodes walked up --"
Anthony M. Kennedy,But --
Trevor S. Cox,-- stood at the end of the driveway and could see the same thing.
Anthony M. Kennedy,But it was in plain view?
Trevor S. Cox,It was.
Anthony M. Kennedy,It's not as if there was a closed garage and they went and opened the garage?
Trevor S. Cox,That's right.
Elena Kagan,"Mr. Cox, was there one search here or were there two searches here?"
Trevor S. Cox,We submit that there was -- there was one search.
Elena Kagan,The search of the motorcycle?
Trevor S. Cox,That's right.
Elena Kagan,"But why is that? Why isn't there the search of the motorcycle -- but there's really the search of the curtilage; it happened to be for the motorcycle, but it's the search of the curtilage, it's a different search entirely."
Trevor S. Cox,"We -- we look at it as one search because it's the object of the search that you are entitled to search, whether it's under a warrant or under a warrant exception. And you look at it by -- you know, it's not a separate search for each access point that you -- you go to. You wouldn't have gotten two warrants if you had gone to a magistrate."
Elena Kagan,"Well, does -- does that mean you, without a warrant, that you always have access to a place if there's a reason that you can seize something that you might find within the place?"
Trevor S. Cox,"I'm hesitant to speak beyond the automobile exception, but I think the automobile exception would give you that, that ability, unless there was some other rule that prevented you from doing it, such as a rule that the automobile exception doesn't apply in the house. And I'll say that, to go back to Justice Gorsuch's questions about the original understanding of this, all along the justifications for the vehicle exception have been based in the contradistinction between vehicles and houses or dwellings. At first it was the difference in mobility, but then later in -- in cases like Cady and Cardwell and Carney, they also speak of the reduced expectations of privacy that you have in a vehicle as compared to a fixed dwelling or a building. So, if the Court were to draw a line, it would -- it would certainly have some -- some healthy pedigree in the Court's previous decisions. Unless there are further questions, thank you."
